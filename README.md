### The Problem CodeHawks Solves

Digital value exchange enabled by decentralised finance and smart contracts requires an outstanding level of security and best practices in order to reach mainstream adoption.&#x20;

O_ver $250B are locked in the DeFi ecosystem, and in the past 6 months alone, over $1B are lost in more than 100 DeFi exploits._ \
\
Last year, **6% of the Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi was stolen**, resulting in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in users and protocols funds, and inherently, faith in the entire eco-sys

On top of that, the process of finding, hiring, and working with expert and reliable auditors has, until now, been extremely rudimental. Protocols were forced to perform word-of-mouth research, with low to zero possibility of ensuring the quality of their audits. \

### How CodeHawks works

There are three core components in every CodeHawks smart contract auditing competition:

1. **Sponsors (protocols)**: Organizations or entities that implement smart contracts.
2. **Judges**: World-leading experts who oversee the audit process and ensure its integrity.
3. **Hawks (auditors)**: Professionals who conduct the actual audit of the smart contracts

### For Sponsors

Protocols approach CodeHawks with their audit requirements. They have the flexibility to choose between:

* **Competitive Audits**: A dynamic audit process where multiple auditors compete to identify vulnerabilities.
* **Private Audits**: A more traditional approach where a selected auditor or team reviews the smart contract.

Here's how to [get started and request an audit for your protocol.](protocol-teams-sponsors/requesting-an-audit.md)

Visit our guide on the [CodeHawks ecosystem](protocol-teams-sponsors/the-ecosystem.md) to read more about the different services we provide to protocols and their teams.

### For Hawks (Auditors)

The Hawks, our Auditors, lie at the heart of the CodeHawks ecosystem.&#x20;

They:

* Engage in competitive audits, showcasing their expertise.
* Get [paid for their findings](hawks-auditors/payouts.md).
* Build a network to find private auditing opportunities.
* Are sometimes eligible to become [community judges](broken-reference).
