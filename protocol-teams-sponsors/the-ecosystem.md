Our team puts together the experience of top-notch worldwide security auditors and a community of thousands of security experts which first priority is making your code secure, reliable, and your users safe.

CodeHawks ensures Protocols and their developers secure their smart contracts and code in 3 ways:

* **Competitive audits**

* **Private audits**

You can dig depper into the difference between [competitive audits and private audits here.](competitive-vs-private-auditings.md)

Here's how each service works.

### 1. CodeHawks Competitive Audits

CodeHawks offers the possibility for protocols to get their smart contracts reviewed by **thousands of best in class web3 security researchers.**

Competitive smart contract auditing competitions involve independent auditors examining the security and reliability of a smart contract simultaneously.

Auditors compete to identify vulnerabilities and inefficiencies, aiming to deliver a comprehensive report. This method ensures multiple perspectives on contract security and promotes a higher level of scrutiny, leading to a **robust and secure code base**.

We put together the best security researchers world wide to secure you and your users.

**Perfect for:**

* Pre-deployment smart contracts
* Smart contracts at their first auditing round

### 2. CodeHawks Private Competitive Audit

In addition to the CodeHawks Competitive Audits, which has any security researcher focusing on your code base, we also provide exclusive closed-entry auditing competitions.\
\
A strategic approach is limited to a selected and agreed-upon group of researchers who will be invited to review your code. **This ensures the highest quality and targeted evaluation of your code.**\
\
This process is similar to a competitive audit, with the distinction being the participating auditors:&#x20;

In a private competition, a selected group of KYC'd auditors or auditing firms, pre-approved by the client, are invited to assess the smart contract, allowing protocols to choose auditors that align with their expectations and needs.\
\
The underlying principle remains the same, with each auditor striving to deliver the most comprehensive report to secure you and your users.\
\
**Perfect for:**

* Pre-deployment smart contracts
* Deployed live smart contracts
* smart contracts at any auditing round

One of our team members will review your repo, assess your responses and contracts, and recommend which audit package would be appropriate for your scope.

Ensuring the security of protocols and their users it's our top priority, making the process for developers and protocol's teams as smooth as possible, is our second:
