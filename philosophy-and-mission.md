**The Current Landscape and Our Response**

* **Challenges in Web3**:
  * Last year alone, 6% of DeFi was compromised due to security breaches.
  * A clear gap exists in understanding how Web3 operates and the unique value it brings to the digital space.
* **Our Strategy**:
  * We are in continuous pursuit of enhanced security best practices, ensuring protocols remain resilient against threats.
  * Weâ€™re working to deliver top-tier educational content to bridge the knowledge gap.

**Token and Governance**

* **Token**: We currently have no token and, in all probability, might never introduce one. But our vision goes beyond tokens.
* **Decentralized Governance**: We're envisioning a decentralized governance system. Our focus is on creating a model thatâ€™s responsive, adaptive, and truly represents the community's best interests.
