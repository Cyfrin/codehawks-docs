# Community Judging Eligibility

A few distinct criteria will be used to determine a user's eligibility to participate in community judging for a contest. &#x20;

To be eligible for community judging a competition, a potential judge must:

1. **Have at least one submission in the Contest they would be judging:** This assures the community judge that they will possess the context and familiarity with the code necessary to provide an accurate and valid submission assessment.
2. **Have earned at least $200 USDC from previous CodeHawks competitions:** This will further mitigate unqualified or inexperienced judges and serve as a Sybil defense mechanism.
3. **Have a total submission to valid submission ratio greater than or equal to 0.2:** This will ensure that only auditors who share Cyfrin's commitment to industry-leading quality can judge other submissions.
