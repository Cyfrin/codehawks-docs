# The Judging Process

The judging phase is critical to Cyfrin CodeHawks' competitive audits, ensuring its contests' integrity, transparency, and fairness.&#x20;

Here's an in-depth look at how the judging process works.

### How does the CodeHawks judging process work?

We split the judging process into two phases:

1. [**Community judging**](the-judging-process.md#community-judging)
2. **Lead judging**

Both happen after the contest's closed submission window, lasting an average of \~ three weeks. Once judging begins, further submissions through the CodeHawks Audit Portal will be disabled.

#### Community judging

All eligible community members can join the community judging phase as judges.

Community Judges will use the CodeHawks portal to submit their assessments to the Lead Judge for each contest, to earn rewards based on their performances and accuracy.

Find more information on Community Judging and how it works [here](how-community-judging-works.md).

You can check out more eligibility information [here](community-judging-eligibility.md)!

#### Lead judging

A member of the Cyfrin team or an appointed, reputable, and esteemed community member may be invited to assist in judging.

While submission volume certainly plays a part, the average judging period is \~2.5 weeks.
