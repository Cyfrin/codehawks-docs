# The Judging Process

The judging phase is a critical component of CodeHawks' competitive audits, ensuring the integrity, transparency, and fairness of the contest.&#x20;

Here's an in-depth look at how the judging process unfolds.

### Timeline

**Post-submission Phase**: After the closure of a contest's submission window, the judging process starts.&#x20;

This will be clearly communicated via announcements on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CodeHawks) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/cyfrin).

**Duration**: While the time taken for judging largely depends on the volume of submissions and size of the codebase, it usually takes approximately 1-2 weeks - check the [Timelines guide](../protocol-teams-sponsors/audit-pricing-and-timelines.md) for more information.

### The Judging Panel

**Current Model**: At present, the Cyfrin team is largely responsible for evaluating the audits, on occasion a reputable and esteemed member of the community may be invited to assist in judging.

**Future Innovations**: We're diligently working towards introducing a decentralized judging model (Community Judging). This model aims to eliminate any potential biases as well as open source the assessments of submitted vulnerabilities.

**Participation Restrictions**: To ensure impartiality, members of the Cyfrin team are prohibited from participating in audit competitions.

### Judging Interactions

**Contest Submissions**: Once judging begins, further submissions through the CodeHawks Audit Portal will be disabled

**Feedback and Comments**: Judges will provide detailed comments on each submission, clarifying their decisions and reasonings. These will be revealed for consideration **only** once the [appeals ](appeals.md)phase begins.

**Descriptive Tags:** Judges will also be leaving descriptive tags of the finding on each valid submission.

### Standards for Validity

Determining the validity of an issue within a specific contest hinges on two primary criteria:

* **Official Contest Specification**: Including known issues and specific cases  - detailed on each [CodeHawks](https://www.codehawks.com) contest's page.
* **Code in Scope**: Specific to the contest.

To learn more about what constitutes a valid finding, please refer to the [What is a Finding?](../hawks-auditors/how-to-determine-a-finding-validity.md) guide.

### Submission Tags

During the judging phase, participants might observe tags being added to their submissions. These tags serve as indicators and can denote various aspects, including:

* **Duplicate Findings**: Identified by a sorting bot, for example, `ai-dup-1785`.
* **Valid Findings**: Recognized by tags like `finding-reentrancy-borrow-function`.
* **Selected Findings**: Denoted by the `selected` tag.
