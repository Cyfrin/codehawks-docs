# The Judging Process

The judging phase is a critical component of CodeHawks' competitive audits, ensuring the integrity, transparency, and fairness of the contest.&#x20;

Here's an in-depth look at how the judging process unfolds.

### Timeline

**Post-submission Phase**: After the closure of a contest's submission window, the judging process starts.&#x20;

This will be clearly communicated via announcements on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CodeHawks) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/cyfrin).

**Duration**: The Community Judging phase will be time locked before being passed to a Lead Judge. The duration of the community phase \<information on duration>. While submission volume certainly plays a part, the average judging period is \~2.5 weeks. Please see the [Timelines Guide](../protocol-teams-sponsors/audit-pricing-and-timelines.md) for more information.

### The Judging Panel

**Lead Judge:** A member of the Cyfrin team or an appointed, reputable and esteemed member of the community may be invited to assist in judging.

**Community Judges:** All eligible members of the community may participate in submission judgement.

You can check out more information on eligibility [here](eligibility.md)!

### Judging Interactions

**Contest Submissions**: Once judging begins, further submissions through the CodeHawks Audit Portal will be disabled

**Judges:** Community Judges will use the CodeHawks portal to submit their assessments to the Lead Judge for each contest.

### Standards for Validity

Determining the validity of an issue within a specific contest hinges on two primary criteria:

* **Official Contest Specification**: Including known issues and specific cases  - detailed on each [CodeHawks](https://www.codehawks.com) contest's page.
* **Code in Scope**: Specific to the contest.

To learn more about what constitutes a valid finding, please refer to the [What is a Finding?](../hawks-auditors/how-to-determine-a-finding-validity.md) guide.

### Submission Tags

During the judging phase, participants might observe tags being added to their submissions. These tags serve as indicators and can denote various aspects, including:

* **Valid Findings**: Recognized by tags like `finding-reentrancy-borrow-function`.
* **Selected Findings**: Denoted by the `selected` tag.
