# Eligibility

There are a few distinct criteria that will be used to determine a user's eligibility to participate in community judging for a contest.  Namely, a potential judge must have:

* **participated in the Contest which they would be judging** - This assures the community judge will possess the context and familiarity with the code necessary to provide accurate and valid submission assessment.
* **a valid submission in a previous CodeHawks contest** - This will further mitigate unqualified or inexperienced judges as well as serve as a sybil defense mechanism.
* **a monetary reward from a previous CodeHawks contest** - similar to the above, but this will assure that the past submissions from the community judge have adhered to a threshold of quality and success.

### First Flights

The criteria for community judging in First Flights may differ from those outlined above. Fewer restrictions may be employed in the pursuit of learning opportunities.
