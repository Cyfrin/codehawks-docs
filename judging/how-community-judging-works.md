# How Community Judging Works

The judging phase will start upon the resolution of the submission period of a competitive audit. At this point, all[ eligible community judges](community-judging-eligibility.md) for a contest will receive an email advising them of the beginning of the judging phase and their [eligibility](community-judging-eligibility.md) to participate.

This page teaches you how to participate in the community judging phase, evaluating others' submissions for a chance to earn [extra rewards](payouts-and-rewards.md).

### Judging Dashboard

Navigate to the judging dashboard by clicking on the "judging" item on the top navbar.

From here, judges can see any contests they are eligible to judge. By hovering over the eligibility information icon, judges can see the [eligibility requirements](community-judging-eligibility.md) to participate in each contest's judgment.&#x20;

The duration of this period will be determined by several factors including, but not limited to:

* **Number of submissions**
* **Number of eligible judges**

### Community Judging Submission View

Clicking 'Judge' will bring one to the Community Judging submission view. The community Judge will be faced with the Community Judging view.&#x20;

In this view, a judge will be randomly assigned one submission at a time, with another assigned after each judgment. There is no limit to the number of submissions a community judge can complete.

A community judge's role is to determine if each submission assigned is valid or invalid and categorize them as such using the radial buttons available in the top right.

### Submission Tags

During the judging phase, participants might observe tags being added to their submissions. These tags serve as indicators and can denote various aspects, including:

* **Valid Findings**: Recognized by tags like `finding-reentrancy-borrow-function`.
* **Selected Findings**: Denoted by the `selected` tag.

Following the conclusion of the community judging period, an assigned Lead Judge will assess the validity of judgments and ultimately determine the performance of community judges.

### Performance

A community judge's performance is determined by comparing the accuracy of their submissions versus the Lead Judge's final verdicts.&#x20;

A community judge will receive +1 point if their judgment matches the Lead Judge's and -1 point if the assessments do not match. This simple system provides a grade of how accurate a community judge's assessments are and ultimately determines [rewards](payouts-and-rewards.md) for participants.

**For example:**

* The community Judge determines ten valid findings and five invalid
* The Lead Judge's verdict matches 8 of the Community Judges' valid and 4 of the CJ's invalid judgments.

The equation looks like this:

**Valid Judgement Matches** - **Valid Judgement Mismatches** + **Invalid Judgement Matches** - **Invalid Judgement Mismatches**

For example: 8 - 2 + 4 - 1 = 9

The community judge in this example would receive 9 points for their 15 judged submissions.
