# Payouts and Rewards

The judging reward pool is set at **10%** of the contest's total prize pool. Payment for the Lead Judge is calculated separately from a contest's total prize pool.

Competitive Judges will be eligible for payouts based on their performance while judging a contest. The **Top 5 community judging participants by total point value** will receive equal portions of the judging pool (2% of total contest prize pool).

**Example:**&#x20;

* Contest is hosted for $50,000 total prize pool
* 10% or $5000 is allotted as a judging pool
* Community Judges are ranked by points earned during the judging period
* Top 5 Community Judges receive $1000 each

### CodeHawks Judging XP

Participants in Community Judging will also be awarded Judging Experience (This is distinct from [CodeHawks XP](../hawks-auditors/how-does-xp-work.md)).&#x20;

These points will be awarded based on a judge's performance at a rate of 1 point = 1 XP.  Judging experience will serve as a measure of one's success and participation within the CodeHawks Community Judging platform with additional use TBD.
