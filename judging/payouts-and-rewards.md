# Payouts and Rewards

The judging reward pool is set at **10%** of the contest's total prize pool. Payment for the Lead Judge is calculated separately from a contest's total prize pool.

Competitive Judges will be eligible for payouts based on their performance while judging a contest. The **Top 5 community judging participants by total point value** will receive equal portions of the judging pool (2% of total contest prize pool).

_**Please note: Payouts may be within 0.0001 USDC margin of error.**_
