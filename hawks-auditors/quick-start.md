# Quick Start

Welcome to Cyfrin CodeHawks! Here's a quick and easy guide to get you started as an auditor and submit your first vulnerabilities.

### **1. Create an account on CodeHawks**

First, create a new account by visiting  [codehawks.cyfrin.io](https://codehawks.cyfrin.io) and clicking the "sign up" button in the top right corner:

### 2. Subscribe to your first CodeHawks competition

Navigate to the competitions page and look for "Live" or "Upcoming" contests:

Clicking on a competition will open its details page, with important information such as:

* [Prize pool](payouts.md) severity breakdowns
* Start and end dates
* [nSLOC](../glossary.md) and scope
* Scoring
* Link to the GitHub repository (if the competition is live)

Every contest also comes with details that will help you understand:

* The codebase
* Scope
* compatibilities
* How to get the codebase up and running

New contests are announced almost every week. When you find a contest that fits your skills, click on the subscribe button to join it:

### 3. Submit your first finding vulnerability

Once you've found your first vulnerability, navigate to the competition page, and click on the submit "submit a vulnerability" button:

To submit your vulnerability, you'll be asked to insert:

* Title - a <250 character descriptive title of your submission
* Severity - a matrix of likelihood and impact characterizing your finding. Read [how-to-evaluate-a-finding-severity.md](how-to-evaluate-a-finding-severity.md "mention")for a full explanation.
* Description - a detailed description of the vulnerability found and how to reproduce it.

Learn more on [how-to-write-and-submit-a-finding.md](how-to-write-and-submit-a-finding.md "mention")on the dedicated guide.

### 5. Await for the judging results&#x20;

**After the auditing period ends, judges will evaluate each submission carefully to determine its validity, severity, and overall quality.**

**Judging is done in two steps:**

* [Community Judging](../judging/how-community-judging-works.md) - a period where all [eligible community judges](../judging/community-judging-eligibility.md) can evaluate others' submissions
* [Lead judging](../judging/the-judging-process.md) - a period where the lead judge confirms or not the community judges' decisions and issue the final pre-appeal judgments.

Every phase will be communicated on the platform and via announcements on [Discord](https://discord.gg/cyfrin).

Learn more about [the judging process](../judging/the-judging-process.md).

### 6. Appeal to the judge's results

For 48 hours following judging, [appeals](appeals.md) will be accepted to contest judgments. This period will be clearly announced across all channels.

\
During the 48 hours, interactions will be enabled on your GitHub submissions. During this time, you may leave comments detailing your escalation for re-assessment.

### 7. Get rewarded

Once the final report is released, results will be announced, and [payouts](payouts.md) will be sent to the winners.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Rewards are paid out in USDC through the ZKsync chain. Crediting the reward won't be possible without a ZKsync wallet connected to the user profile.
