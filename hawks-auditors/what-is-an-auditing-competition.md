# What is an Auditing Competition?

A smart contract auditing competition is an event where participants (Hawks!) review a given smart contract or a set of smart contracts to identify vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and any other potential issues. These auditors compete against each other to find as many [valid issues](how-to-write-and-submit-a-finding.md) as possible, and they are rewarded based on the [significance](how-to-evaluate-a-finding-severity.md) and [quality](how-to-determine-a-finding-validity.md) of their findings.

### **How does a CodeHawks auditing competition works:**

### 2. **Kick-Off**

The official start of the competition. From this point, participants can access the contract repo and begin their auditing process. Findings can be submitted through the [contest](https://www.codehawks.com/contests) page on the web portal.

We'll be hosting a Live Kick-Off stream for each contest to introduce the code base and interview sponsors, so don't miss those on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwlGG-aBeR95seT49XetR8A)!

### 3. Auditing period

* Auditors delve deep into the provided smart contract(s), using their expertise to uncover vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and other issues and recommendations. These findings are submitted to judges for assessment in the next phase.
* This period is time-bound, ensuring a level playing field.
* The amount of time allotted for a competition is largely determined by the size of the code base being audited

**4.** [**Judging Period**](broken-reference)

* Once the auditing period concludes, the _CodeHawks_ team or appointed judges will review the submissions. This is to validate the findings, rank them based on severity, and prepare for the next phase.
* Length of this period is largely determined by number of submissions received.
* Community Judging models are being created to speed up the judging process and afford opportunities for auditor community feedback.

### 5. [**Escalation Period**](broken-reference)

* For **48 hours** following the completion of initial judging, auditors can raise concerns or objections about the decisions made during the judging phase. Itâ€™s a window for the community to ensure transparency and fairness.

### 6. [**Reward Payout**](payouts.md)

* After addressing escalations, the final results are announced, and rewards are distributed to auditors based on the quality and significance of their findings.
* Payouts are distributed within 72 hours from the closure of the escalation period and are currently paid in USDC on Arbitrum one L2 leveraging [wentokens.xyz](https://www.wentokens.xyz/) for gas-optimized transactions.

In addition to the above, CodeHawks will be introducing a innovative [XP system](how-does-xp-work.md) to reward auditors for their time, dedication and contributions within the community and unique opportunities will be made available to profiles as they advance.\
