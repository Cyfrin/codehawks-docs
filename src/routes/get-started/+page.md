Right now, the industry has the following issues:
1. 6% of DeFi was hacked last year
2. Projects don't know which auditors are good
3. And the process of finding auditors is to "DM them on Twitter" or "Google it" 

We need to fix this. 

## Solution

A marketplace for smart contract auditors:
- Where projects can see other auditors reputation.
- Smart Contract auditors don't need to be marketing pros, and can focus on their work. 
- And a place to compete, so we can have an objective measure of auditors skills.

## How it works for projects/protocols

1. Protocol comes to CodeHawks and requests an audit, they can choose from:
   1. [Competitive Audits](/audits/)
   2. [Private Audits](/audits/)
2. And the protocol sets everything up to match them with the best auditors for their needs!
