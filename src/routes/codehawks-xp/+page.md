# CodeHawks XP System

This system is designed to recognize and reward the efforts of our auditors and community members. Here’s how it works:

### Earning XP:

1. **Submission-based XP**: Each time you make a valid submission, you earn XP based on its severity rating post-judging. The default XP rewards are as follows:

   - Gas: 1 XP
   - Low: 2 XP
   - Medium: 20 XP
   - High: 100 XP

   **Note:** XP values given are a current default. These numbers are subject to change at the discretion of the CodeHawks team, any changes will be clearly communicated in advance.

2. **Team Submissions**: If you're part of a team, every member of the team will earn XP for each valid submission made by the team. However, to ensure fairness and reduce the chances of piggy-backing, there is a scaling mechanism based on team size:
   - Teams of ≤5 : Each member gets 100% XP
   - Team of 6 : Each member gets 90% XP
   - Team of 7 : Each member gets 80% XP
   - Team of 8 : Each member gets 70% XP
   - Team of 9 : Each member gets 60% XP
   - Teams of 10+ : Each member gets 50% XP

**More ways to come…**

### Current Use of XP:

At present, the XP you earn is primarily a recognition of your contribution and expertise. While there is no specific leveling system in place right now, we plan to incorporate it in the future.

### Future Benefits:

As we further develop the XP system, you can expect to unlock various benefits, including:

- Visual accolades, highlighting your expertise and contributions.
- Eligibility to participate in community voting and other exclusive opportunities.

**Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements to the XP system!**
