# Why CodeHawks?

## Audit Marketplace

1. Competitive audit submissions are 100% anonymous, this way, their is no bias in judging
2. We have no token, and therefore we are not [plutocratic](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/03/28/plutocracy.html)
3. We ship educational content, to make you the best auditor you can be
4. We fight for transparency, and do all we can to make Web3 a better place, and raise the DeFi TVL
5. Anon judging, we are dedicated to making sure that incentives are always in favor of fairness. 

## Coming soon...

4. As an auditor, we are working on being the end-to-end marketplace for auditors, so you can get all your inbound from CodeHawks! (Coming soon..)
5. As a protocol, you won't have to DM hundreds of auditors on Twitter, you can just post your audit here and pick the best auditor for your project (Coming soon..)
