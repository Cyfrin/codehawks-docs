#### nSLOC:

nSLOC stands for 'Normalized Source Code', which is a custom measurement we use (among others) when evaluating the complexity of a codebase.

To get the NSLOC count of a file:

1. For all functions, reduce any multiline function declarations to a single line.
2. Remove all comments
3. Remove all empty lines
4. Count the remaining lines



**PoC - Proof of Concept**

A proof of concept (PoC) is a demonstration or experiment that seeks to validate the feasibility, functionality, and potential of a particular idea, concept, or method. Typically used in the early stages of development, a PoC demonstrates that a concept or theory has practical potential for real-world application. It doesn't aim to represent a finished product or solution but instead serves as a foundational step to verify that a certain idea can be developed further into a functional prototype or product.



**QAs - Quality Assurance**

QA reports are essential documents in software development and testing processes that highlight the status, progress, and potential issues of a particular product or system under evaluation. Here's a brief overview of what a QA report might entail:



**Hawks**

The amazing community of auditors on [codehawks.com](https://codehawks.com)



**Sponsor**\
Any protocol's team or developers willing to make their smart contracts more secure, and their users safe by sponsoring a [smart contract auditing competition](protocol-teams-sponsors/the-ecosystem.md) on Codehawks.com

#### Complexity

The complexity of a code base or smart contract, calculated using [Solidity Core Metrics](https://github.com/Consensys/solidity-metrics) taking into consideration:

* nSLOC
* Number of contracts

And other parameters

#### **Finding**

Any submission done by a Hawk (auditor) to a contest reporting a bug or potential exploitation vector in a smart contract or codebase
