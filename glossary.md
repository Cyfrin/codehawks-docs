<details>

<summary>nSLOC</summary>

nSLOC stands for 'Normalized Source Lines of Code', a custom measurement we use (among other things) to evaluate the complexity of a codebase.

To get the NSLOC count of a file:

1. For all functions, reduce any multiline function declarations to a single line.
2. Remove all comments
3. Remove all empty lines
4. Count the remaining lines

<summary>PoC - Proof of Concept</summary>

A proof of concept (PoC) is a demonstration or experiment that seeks to validate the feasibility, functionality, and potential of a particular idea, concept, or method. Typically used in the early stages of development, a PoC demonstrates that a concept or theory has practical potential for real-world application. It doesn't aim to represent a finished product or solution. Instead, verifying that a specific idea can be developed into a functional prototype or product is a foundational step.
